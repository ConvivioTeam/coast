# COAST

## Example Contract

This is an example of how COAST builds up complete agreements from separate clauses.

This example uses clauses from the main clause library, as well as a local clause that is specific to this agreement. In the same way it takes the central definitions and adds some specific local ones.

You can see the files that make up this example contract in this folder.

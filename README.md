## Contracts for Open and Agile Software Teams

The aim of this project is to develop standard contract templates for digital teams that truly support Agile working, the use of Open Source, and effective collaboration to deliver successful outcomes.

An [example contract template](./ContractTemplates/EN-GB/Example) (which you can [view the compiled output of](http://htmlpreview.github.com/?https://github.com/ConvivioTeam/coast/blob/master/ContractTemplates/EN-GB/Example/example.html)) demonstrates how the templates are built. Duplicate this folder to create new contract templates from scratch.

Work is currently underway to produce:
* A simple and fair Non-Disclosure Agreement (NDA)
* A framework contract for digital projects
* A Statement Of Work template for use under the framework
* A Partner agreement for agencies that choose to work together
* A Freelance/Contractor agreement for engaging individuals to add to a team

The work can be followed in the 'Projects' tab of this Github repository. Please open tickets her on Github with ideas and contributions.

At present the templates are only in British English, intended for the UK market.

Our help section includes details of [How To Contribute](./Help/contributing.md).

The templates are written in Asciidoc format. Our [Asciidoc help page](./Help/asciidoc.md) explains what this is and to use it.

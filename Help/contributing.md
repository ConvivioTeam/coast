## Contributing workflow

If you are familiar with gthub, or technically able enough to learn it, then here’s how we suggest you go about proposing a change to this project:

1. [Fork this project][fork] to your account.
2. [Create a branch][branch] for the change you intend to make.
3. Make your changes to your fork.
4. [Send a pull request][pr] from your fork’s branch to our `master` branch.

Using the web-based interface on github to make changes is fine too, and will help you
by automatically forking the project and prompting to send a pull request too.

[branch]: https://help.github.com/articles/creating-and-deleting-branches-within-your-repository
[pr]: https://help.github.com/articles/using-pull-requests/

If you really aren't technically able enough for this, then please feel free to open tickets with suggested changes or additions.

NOTE:
Anything you contribute to the project should be your own work, and you understand that by contributing it, your work will be available under the Creative Commons license under which the whole project is licensed.
